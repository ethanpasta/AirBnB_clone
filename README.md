## Description

This is the final 4 month project at Holberton School San Francisco. The goal of the project is to deploy a simple copy of the AirBnB website - hBnB. The web application will be composed by:

- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell (for development and debugging)
- A website (front-end) that show the final product to everyone: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete and update them)
---

## Final Product

## Step 1: The Console

* Create a data model
* Manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console/command interpreter
* Store and persist objects to files (JSON files)

The first step is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give an abstraction between objects and how they are stored and persisted.
